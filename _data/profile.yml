  <p>
    My research focuses on the computational protein design and geometric deep learning for scientific discovery. I am particularly passionate about leveraging AI for drug discovery and design, with an emphasis on proteins and small molecules. <strong>My goal is to develop effective AI methods to accelerate advancements in medicine and therapeutics.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.</strong> I am always open to collaborations and discussions. Please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my research or have any questions.
