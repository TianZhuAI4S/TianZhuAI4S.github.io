abstract: >-
  This method integrates innovative molecular encoders for both 2D graphs and 3D conformations, enabling the accurate capture of geometric dependencies among edges in graph-based molecular structures. Furthermore, GTAM is bolstered by the development of two contrastive training objectives designed to facilitate the direct transfer of edge information between 2D topological graphs and 3D geometric conformations, enhancing the functionality of the molecular encoders.
